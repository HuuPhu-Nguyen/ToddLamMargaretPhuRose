 **How we built it**  
We used Electron to be the whole app. We tried to use python to code a gemini API call. It was successful, but we were not able to get it to work on Electron’s interface.
 
**Challenges and Accomplishments:**  
The biggest challenges we faced during the Hackathon was reading the json files, tiredness especially as the day went on, getting the chatbot to run on the Electron application through API calls was tougher than expected, and making a project while learning new things about javaScript since we really have not used JavaScript much. We overcame the tiredness by taking short breaks and overcame our struggles by learning many things and doing the best we can. Our best accomplishments is that we learned how to use Electron and learn how to build a website that has many different buttons with nice looking UI. We are also proud of how much we learned Javascript because it is not familiar to us, yet we still managed to make an application. Something new we learned is that incorporating Javascript and html is harder than expected.
 
**What’s next?:**  
We will learn how to make API calls in Electron to get our chatbot to work in Electron. We also need to learn how reading the json in asynchronous functions. We could search up when we are better rested how to do it online.
